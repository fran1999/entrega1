## Introduction
For this fullstack implementation I used ReactJS to build the frontend, and Java Sring Boot for the REST API in the backend. For data persistance I used Mariabd with xapp.

### Tools Versions
* Java: 17.0.6
* MySQL: 8.0
* Spring Boot: 3.1.0
* React: 18.2.0
* Node: 16.14.2
* npm: 8.5.0

## Run the application
Once the repository is cloned onto the local computer (and all tools are installed):

1. Start the xampp application with the command "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start" and create a DB schema called "notes" with user "root" and password ""

2. Open the folder "backend-notes" from an IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ) and run the exerciseAplication class.

3. Run the frontend server from the command line: cd into the folder "frontend-notes"run the "npm ci" command, and finally run the "npm start" command
